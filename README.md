# 42 Common Core

This repository contains the projects I completed as part of the 42 Common Core curriculum.

**About 42:**  
42 is an innovative, tuition-free programming school founded in Paris.  
Its pedagogy is entirely project-based and peer-to-peer, emphasizing autonomy, problem-solving,
and collaboration without traditional teachers or lectures.

## Norminette and Coding Standards

All C projects at 42 must adhere to the Norminette, the school’s official coding standard.  
This set of rules ensures consistent formatting, clarity, and maintainable code across all student work.

Key constraints include:

- No `for` loops (only `while` loops are permitted)  
- No `switch` statements (control flow must rely on `if`/`else`)  
- Maximum of 25 lines per function  
- Maximum of 4 parameters per function  
- Use of only a limited subset of the C standard library unless specifically allowed  
- Strict rules regarding indentation, spacing, naming conventions, and file structure

These requirements promote strong programming discipline and a solid foundation in low-level software development.

**Note:** Due to copyright restrictions, original project subjects cannot be shared.  
For assignments requiring additional context, a README is provided summarizing the main objectives and key concepts.
