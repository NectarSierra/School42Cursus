# 42 Common Core

This repository contains all the exercises I completed as part of the 42 Common Core curriculum.

**About 42:**  
42 is an innovative, tuition-free programming school founded in Paris.  
Its learning model is fully project-based, peer-to-peer, and emphasizes autonomy, problem-solving,
and collaboration without traditional teachers or lectures.

> Due to copyright restrictions, I cannot share the original project subjects.  
> However, for projects that require context, I have added a README summarizing the main objectives and concepts of each assignment.
