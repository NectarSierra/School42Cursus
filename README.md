# 🎓 School42 Cursus

Welcome to my collection of projects and exercises completed throughout the 42 Common Core curriculum.

## 🏫 What is 42?
**42** is a free, peer-to-peer coding school with no teachers, no classes, and no prerequisites.  
Learning happens through hands-on projects, collaboration, and problem-solving — all at your own pace.

> Due to copyright restrictions, I cannot share the original project subjects.  
> However, for projects that require context, I have added a README summarizing the main objectives and concepts of each assignment.
